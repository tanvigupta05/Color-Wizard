Random Color Generator
I have made this color generator project using HTML, javascript and Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. Bootstrap provides a set of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and grid layouts, which can be easily customized and integrated into web projects. 
I have also used external css as there are some styling elements which are still not defined in bootstrap yet.
